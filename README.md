Escape from Tarkov website

Current Version: 0.0.4

## Todo
-Number don't matter, but it's in a state that I can actually mess with the site now

-Need to reactify the pages that handle the GoogleAPI stuff (ammo.html and barter.html)

      barter complete, need to work on ammo
 
-Clean up CSS and make it not look bad. Re-create style from EFT website perhaps?

-Eventually put this somewhere for people to see.

-Figure out why Font's are weird.
