# Scav Co
Escape from Tarkov website for all your EFT needs. Links out to many guides and resources but I am working on trying to house everything in one area while providing unique tools that people can use.

**Written in:** [React](https://reactjs.org/)

**Current Version: 0.0.6**

---

## Currently working on:

* Eventually put this somewhere for people to see

* Finish up the imaging for bartering categories

* Finish up ammo types

* Redo Posts js
     
  * Should contain itslef in a "Trading Tab"
  * WTS, WTB and WTT are sub page navigation options
  * Tidbit at the bottom to inform where this data is coming from

* Clean up naviagtion and unify it

* Fix up the mobile view because it's terrible

---

## Planned:

* Search barter page by categories as well as traders (Categories from in game / will use same imaging)

* Trade login to post trades on site as well as automatically to the trade sub reddit

* Api pull from multiple discords that have trade channels and post them on site (maybe have the login post there as well eventually)

* News page with latest patch notes

* Maps that are clean but have styling per user (shareable styles) similar to DayZ maps and the sorts

* Additional tools (brought over from other devs or simply linked to)

---

## Finished

*0.0.5*

      * Clean up CSS and make it not look bad. Re-create style from EFT website perhaps? 
            -- Copied subreddit styling (which is similar to websites)
      
      * Figure out why Font's are weird. 
            -- Fixed in Webpack config

*0.0.4*

      * Need to reactify the pages that handle the GoogleAPI stuff (ammo.html and barter.html)

          * barter complete, need to work on ammo
