## Currently working on:

* Data Sorting

* Markers for the maps and cross reference from other tabs

* Crossover data from several sources and notate which is "Offical" and which is community related

---

## Back Burner:

* Finish up the imaging for bartering categories

* Finish up ammo types

---

## Planned:

* Search barter page by categories as well as traders (Categories from in game / will use same imaging)

* Trade login to post trades on site as well as automatically to the trade sub reddit

* Discord integiraiton for trades / meet ups

* Api pull from multiple discords that have trade channels and post them on site (maybe have the login post there as well eventually)

* News page with latest patch notes

* Maps that are clean but have styling per user (shareable styles) similar to DayZ maps and the sorts

* Additional tools (brought over from other devs or simply linked to)

---
