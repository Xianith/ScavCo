# Scav Co
Escape from Tarkov website for all your EFT needs. Links out to many guides and resources but I am working on trying to house everything in one area while providing unique tools that people can use.

**Written in:** [React](https://reactjs.org/)

**Current Version: 0.0.5**

---

## Currently working on:

-Clean up CSS and make it not look bad. Re-create style from EFT website perhaps?

-Eventually put this somewhere for people to see.

-Figure out why Font's are weird.

---

## Planned:

-Search barter page by categories as well as traders (Categories from in game / will use same imaging)

-Trade login to post trades on site as well as automatically to the trade sub reddit

-Api pull from multiple discords that have trade channels and post them on site (maybe have the login post there as well eventually)

-News page with latest patch notes

-Maps that are clean but have styling per user (shareable styles) similar to DayZ maps and the sorts

---

## Finished

*0.0.4*

      -Number don't matter, but it's in a state that I can actually mess with the site now

      -Need to reactify the pages that handle the GoogleAPI stuff (ammo.html and barter.html)

            barter complete, need to work on ammo
